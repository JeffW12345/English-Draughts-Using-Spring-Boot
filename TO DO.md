TO DO

# TO BE DELETED ONCE PROJECT GOES LIVE

When new game accepted after previous game, reset GUIs. 

Check encapsulation as tight as possible.

Write messages in GuiMessageController to cater for a change of turn or the current turn being ongoing

Explore a better approach that system.exit(1) to shutting down when a player closes their GUI.

Check that synchronisation is as tight as it could be. Consider making some of the classes with static methods 
into objects.

Testing

Can I get rid of amIRed and have a Colour object instead, for simplicity?

Can we get rid of dictionaries by storing the clientIds in objects? 

Ensure README up-to-date and complete. Consider JavaDocs. Put notes about the GUI in the readme.

Explore if code in JumpPossibleValidationService can be recycled for other checks to avoid code repetition.
